# Tagging

In this section we will work with Tags to retain a Snapshot for 365 days.  Iceberg tagging is available in Hive only. Iceberg tagging is not available in Impala or Spark.

Tags are named references to snapshots with their own independent lifecycle.  You can use a <b>Tag</b> to set retention policies on specific Snapshots.  Tags can also be a convient way to query specific snapshots without having to deal or remember snapshot ids - this could be something you use for month end reporting. Other use cases inclue GDPR requirements and retaining important historical snapshots for auditing.

**Query the Flights' Table History (in CDW HUE)**

- Execute the following in HUE for Hive VW

```
SELECT *
FROM ${prefix}_airlines.flights.HISTORY;
```

- In results you see various Snapshots that have been created.  From the results, copy the Snapshot ID for the first Snapshot.  This was the original data loaded into the table.


**Create Tag to Retain Snapshot for 365 Days**

- Execute the following in HUE for Hive VW

- Enter "audit" in the tag_name prompt

```
-- CREATE TAG (for the tag_name do NOT use capital letters)
ALTER TABLE ${prefix}_airlines.flights 
   CREATE TAG `${tag_name}` 
   FOR SYSTEM_VERSION AS OF ${snapshot_ID} 
   RETAIN 365 DAYS;
```

**Query the Flights' Table  (in CDW HUE)**

- Execute the following in HUE for Hive VW

- Paste the copied Snapshot ID into the "snapshot_id" prompt box

```
-- SHOW ALL TAGS & BRANCHES
SELECT * from ${prefix}_airlines.flights.REFS;
```

- In results you see the Tag named **audit** and if looking at the retention column you can see that this Tag is retained for 365 days represented in milliseconds

**Query the Audit Tag Created for the Flights' Table (in CDW HUE)**

- Execute the following to query the Tag

- Enter "tag_audit" in the tag_name prompt.  When using a Tag to query data you'll need to append "tag_" before the name of the Tag in the previous step.


```
-- Query tag to see data in the Tag
SELECT *
  FROM ${prefix}_airlines.flights.${tag_name}
LIMIT 100;
```

**Simulate a month end use case - Query the Audit Tag Created for the Flights' Table (in CDW HUE)**

- Execute the following to query the Tag

- Executing this query will show the same data as when we used Time Travel using the Snapshot.  However, in this case I just need to use the Tag name following the table, instead of remembering the syntax for Time Travel and the snapshot id I wanted to view.  The data will be for years 1995-2006

- Enter "tag_audit" in the tag_name prompt.


```
SELECT year, count(*)
FROM ${prefix}_airlines.flights.${tag_name}
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year DESC;
```
